# Security Policy

## Supported versions

The current release series and the next most recent one (by major-minor version) will receive patches and new versions in case of a security issue.

### Unsupported Release Series

When a release series is no longer supported, itâ€™s your own responsibility to deal with bugs and security issues. If you are not comfortable maintaining your own versions, you should upgrade to a supported version.
