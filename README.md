# Treblle SDK for Ruby on Rails

Treblle makes it super easy to understand whatâ€™s going on with your APIs and the apps that use them. Just by adding Treblle to your API out of the box you get:

* Real-time API monitoring and logging
* Auto-generated API docs with OAS support
* API analytics
* Quality scoring
* One-click testing
* API managment on the go
* and more...

## Requirements
* Ruby 2.0+
* Ruby on Rails 4.0+

## Setup

Add the gem to your Gemfile:

```rb
# Gemfile
gem "treblle", "~> 1.0"
```

Then add following line to `config/application.rb`, or if you want to include it to specific environment only, then e.g. `config/environments/development.rb` which registers Treblle middleware.

```rb
config.middleware.use(Treblle)
```

Finally, make sure to set environemnt variables as described below:

| Variable                | Description                                                                      |
| :----------------       | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TREBLLE_API_KEY         | (required) Valid API key obtained during registration on treblle.com             |
| TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID      | (required) Valid Project ID obtained after creating a new project on treblle.com |
| TREBLLE_SENSITIVE_FIELDS| (optional) Additional optional keys that will be masked before sending to Treblle|

`TREBLLE_SENSITIVE_FIELDS` should be comma separated values like: `cc_number,cvv,dont_show_this_field`.
